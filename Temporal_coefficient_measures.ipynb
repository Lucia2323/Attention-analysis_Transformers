        "# Multi-timescale differentiation in Transformer attention\n",
        "In this notebook we examine differences in attention patterns of a Transformer model processing scrambled vs. non-scrambled texts. We create texts scrambled at several different levels inspired by the Temporal Receptive Window hierarchy of [Lerner et al. (2011)](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/31/8/2906). For each level we compare attention head behaviours when the model processes the original text vs. scrambled text, using median k-value and mean weighted average distance measures.\n",

            "original txt 5807 \t In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell. They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox— points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they’d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest. “That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.” Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. “No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. “You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” Harry was rubbing his forehead. “I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps hurting— it’s happened before, but never as often as this.” “Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested. “I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning... it means danger’s coming...” Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. “Harry Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but... Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. “Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily. “I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” “Why Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. “Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it before?” “What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer. Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl. “Hullo Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?” “Yes Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off. “No No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?” “Dunno Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.” He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. “It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head— that’s one of the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.” Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. “What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?” “Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. “Yeah Yeah... he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him... an’ I said what I’d always really wanted was a dragon... an’ then... I can’ remember too well, ‘cause he kept buyin’ me drinks... Let’s see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home... So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy...” “And did he— did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. “Well Well— yeah— how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep—” Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. “I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! Hey— where’re yeh goin’?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds. “We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak— it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s office?” They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. “We’ll just have to—” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall. “What are you three doing inside?” It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. “We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. “See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why Why?” Harry swallowed— now what? “It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared. “Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.” “He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now Now?” “Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time-” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor Professor— it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone—” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up. “How do you know—?” she spluttered. “Professor Professor, I think— I know— that Sn— that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.” She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. “Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. “I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.” “But Professor—” “Potter Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.” But they didn’t. “It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.” “But what can we—” Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. Snape was standing there. “Good afternoon,” he said smoothly. They stared at him. “You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted smile. “We were—” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say. “You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around like this, people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can it?” Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. “Be warned, Potter— any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.” He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. “Right Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape— wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.” “Why me?” “It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “‘Oh ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong...’” “Oh Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. “And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron. “Come on.” But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper. “I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” she stonned. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!” Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. “I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.” “Well Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said. The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. “I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone first.” “You’re mad!” said Ron. “You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!” “SO WHAT” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?” He glared at them. “You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice. “I’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got it back.” “But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron. “All All— all three of us?” “Oh Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?” “Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go and look through my books, there might be something useful...” “But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” “Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me out after that.” After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. “Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy— he didn’t feel much like singing. He ran back down to the common room. “We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own—” “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d been making another bid for freedom. “Nothing Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. Neville stared at their guilty faces. “You’re going out again,” he said. “No No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No No, we’re not. Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?” Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. “You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.” But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. “I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. “I’ll I’ll— I’ll fight you!” “Neville Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot—” “Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” “Yes Yes, but not to us” said Ron in exasperation. “Neville Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.” He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. “Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. “I’m ready!” Harry turned to Hermione. “Do something,” he said desperately. Hermione stepped forward. “Neville Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.” She raised her wand. “Petrificus Totalus!” she cried, pointing it at Neville. Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were jammed together so he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. “What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered. “It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” “We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry. “You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak. But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top. “Oh Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything. They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. “Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. “Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.” Harry had a sudden idea. “Peeves Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.” Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs. “So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,” he said greasily. “My mistake, my mistake— I didn’t see you— of course I didn’t, you’re invisible— forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.” “I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay away from this place tonight.” “I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again. “Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.” And he scooted off. “Brilliant Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron. A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor— and the door was already ajar. “Well Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past Fluffy.” Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. “If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.” “Don’t be stupid,” said Ron. “We’re coming,” said Hermione. Harry pushed the door open. As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them. “What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered. “Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.” “It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well Well, here goes...” He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased— it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep. “Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. “I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?” “No No, I don’t!” “All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. “What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously. “Nothing Nothing— just black— there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.” Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. “You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.” Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep. Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?” “Right Right,” said Ron. “See you in a minute, I hope...” And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and— FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. “It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!” Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. “What’s this stuff?” were his first words. “Dunno Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!” The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side. “We must be miles under the school,” she said. “Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron. “Lucky Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!” She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing. Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them. “Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is— it’s Devil’s Snare!” “Oh Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. “Shut up. I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione. “Well Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. “Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare... what did Professor Sprout say?— it likes the dark and the damp.” “So light a fire!” Harry choked. “Yes Yes— of course— but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her hands. “HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” “Oh Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. “Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. “Yeah Yeah,” said Ron,“ and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis— ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon— Norbert had been bad enough... “Can you hear something?” Ron whispered. Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. “Do you think it’s a ghost?” “I don’t know... sounds like wings to me.” “There’s light ahead— I can see something moving.” They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. “Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron. “Probably Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there’s no other choice... I’ll run.” He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm. “Now what?” said Ron. “These birds... they can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione. They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering— glittering? “They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re keys! Winged keys— look carefully. So that must mean...” he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. “...yes ...yes ..yes .yes yes— look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the door!” “But there are hundreds of them!” Ron examined the lock on the door. “We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one— probably silver, like the handle.” They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. “That one!” he called to the others. “That big one— there— no, there— with bright blue wings— the feathers are all crumpled on one side.” Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. “We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. “Ron Ron, you come at it from above— Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I’ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!” Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione’s cheers echoed around the high chamber. They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned- it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. “Ready Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly- the towering white chessmen had no faces. “Now what do we do?” Harry whispered. “It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way across the room.” Behind the white pieces they could see another door. “How How?” said Hermione nervously. “I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.” He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight’s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. “Do we— er— have to join you to get across?” The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. “This needs thinking about...” he said. “I suppose we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces...” Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, “Now Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess—” “We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what to do.” “Well Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.” “What about you?” “I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron. The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took. “White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering across the board. “Yes Yes... look...” A white pawn had moved forward two squares. Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry’s knees were trembling. What if they lost? “Harry Harry— move diagonally four squares to the right.” Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown. “Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.” Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. “We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think— let me think...” The white queen turned her blank face toward him. “Yes Yes...” said Ron softly, “It’s the only way... I’ve got to be taken.” “NO NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted. “That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices! I make my move and she’ll take me— that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!” “But But—” “Do you want to stop Snape or not?” “Ron Ron—” “Look Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!” There was no alternative. “Ready Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go— now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.” He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor— Hermione screamed but stayed on her square— the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d been knocked out. Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway. “What if he’s—?” “He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What do you reckon’s next?” “We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s.” They had reached another door. “All right?” Harry whispered. “Go on.” Harry pushed it open. A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. “I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.” He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next- but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. “Snape’s Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?” They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\n",

            "sentence scrambling:\t\t 501 \t “They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. A white pawn had moved forward two squares. “Do you want to stop Snape or not?” Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. “I suppose we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces...” “I think it’s a warning... it means danger’s coming...” Yes, Weasley, from my own house!” What if they lost? “But Professor—” He reached the door untouched. “You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. They couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. “See you in a minute, I hope...” Ron started to direct the black pieces. “You’re going out again,” he said. “What’s this stuff?” were his first words. “...yes ...yes ..yes .yes yes— look! In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. “Let me think— let me think...” “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.” “What if he’s—?” Neville stared at their guilty faces. “We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one— probably silver, like the handle.” Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. “Why Why?” “We’ll just have to—” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. “I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.” Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. “Nothing Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. “You’re mad!” said Ron. “Well Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.” “It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” Harry swallowed— now what? Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. “I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. “It’s just lucky I got it back.” “Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. Their very last exam was History of Magic. As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. You know that night you won Norbert? Losing points doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. “Be warned, Potter— any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown. He looked as if he’d been knocked out. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.” “Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak— it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. “If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. They’re not throwing me out after that.” Harry’s knees were trembling. “Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. Are you sure?” said Ron. Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. “We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” “Right Right,” said Ron. They had won. They had practical exams as well. “You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.” Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d been making another bid for freedom. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor— “Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. “Snape must have left it there.” Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.” “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took. He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight’s horse. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly- the towering white chessmen had no faces. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. “My mistake, my mistake— I didn’t see you— of course I didn’t, you’re invisible— forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.” “What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? “He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “Come on.” Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. “Petrificus Totalus!” she cried, pointing it at Neville. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? “No No, we’re in a hurry. Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. Ron followed right away. “Snape’s Snape’s,” said Harry. They nodded. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. “But But—” “I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again. In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. “I’m not ill,” said Harry. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. “You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted smile. He put on a high voice, “‘Oh ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong...’” “Potter Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. “No No, no, no,” said Hermione. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.” They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. “Don’t you understand? He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. “He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much. At once, the stone sprang to life. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they’d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. “Come on, I can’t breathe.” “Oh Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up. “I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Here I go— now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.” They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. “Look Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor Professor— it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone—” Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?” They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had reached another door. Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. “Do something,” he said desperately. “Yes Yes...” said Ron softly, “It’s the only way... He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. “And did he— did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything. Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. “I know what this is— it’s Devil’s Snare!” “Good afternoon,” he said smoothly. “But what can we—” Hermione gasped. “Oh Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, but Harry shook his head. “It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!” Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; “You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice. “You can’t!” said Hermione. He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. “I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. Harry pushed the door open. “It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. He glared at them. It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! “Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. Ron and Hermione’s cheers echoed around the high chamber. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. Harry hardly drew breath. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. “I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron. “Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. Ron examined the lock on the door. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. “Shut up. “Harry Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. “Harry Harry— move diagonally four squares to the right.” He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. “Now what?” said Ron. “Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested. “Yes Yes, but not to us” said Ron in exasperation. “Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep—” Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. “I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” she stonned. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices! “What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer. “Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.” He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. “Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily. “I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Why me?” “Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? “Peeves Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.” I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.” “Enough of this nonsense! The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can it?” “Hanging around like this, people will think you’re up to something. Hey— where’re yeh goin’?” Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though. Good day to you.” his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl. She raised her wand. Harry pushed it open. Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like a very good omen. Ron called, his face pale but determined. “I don’t know... sounds like wings to me.” “Ron Ron, you come at it from above— Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I’ll try and catch it. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. Behind the white pieces they could see another door. “Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.” She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. “Oh Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. “We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. Winged keys— look carefully. “Don’t be stupid,” said Ron. They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. They stared at him. “Nothing Nothing— just black— there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.” With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. “Ron Ron—” Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but... But they didn’t. “We’ve got to play our way across the room.” “No No, I don’t!” “And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon— Norbert had been bad enough... Finally he said, “Now Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess—” “I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the dog’s back. Harry and Ron wheeled round. “That one!” he called to the others. “HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “Stay away from this place tonight.” Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. “This needs thinking about...” he said. “Brilliant Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and— FLUMP. If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Voldemort killed my parents, remember?” She landed on Harry’s other side. They moved silently wherever he sent them. “We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry. “Now Now?” He rammed it into the lock and turned- it worked. “These birds... they can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione. It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. After a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. The other two followed him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. “Well Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” “Probably Probably,” said Harry. the white queen dragged Ron to one side. “How do you know—?” she spluttered. “Well Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. “I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs. “Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare... what did Professor Sprout say?— it likes the dark and the damp.” “It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head— that’s one of the pub down in the village. “Dunno Dunno, some sort of plant thing. There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! Neville’s jaws were jammed together so he couldn’t speak. “How do you think you’d get to the Stone without us? Right, NOW!” Broomsticks! Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. D’you think he’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? Hermione screamed but stayed on her square— “We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?” Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. “Want to go first, Hermione?” but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home... I make my move and she’ll take me— that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!” It wasn’t really a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. “White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering across the board. They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering— glittering? Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds. “It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs. “Professor Professor, I think— I know— that Sn— that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. an’ I said what I’d always really wanted was a dragon... an’ then... I can’ remember too well, ‘cause he kept buyin’ me drinks... He ran back down to the common room. A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. “But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” “We were—” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say. I’ve got to be taken.” All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. Did you mention Hogwarts at all?” On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. “Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron. His legs sprang together. “Well Well, here goes...” They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. The other two stared at him. Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. “Neville Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.” He pulled the door open. He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next- Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. “Yes Yes... look...” “What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered. “But there are hundreds of them!” “Hullo Hullo,” he said, smiling. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them. “That big one— there— no, there— with bright blue wings— the feathers are all crumpled on one side.” “I’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “Lucky Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Yeah Yeah,” said Ron,“ and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis— ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “NO NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted. There was no alternative. “Oh Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. “So light a fire!” Harry choked. “Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.” “We’re coming,” said Hermione. “I don’t think you should be breaking any more rules! “SO WHAT” Harry shouted. Harry listened. “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t follow. Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. “Look Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!” We’ve got to catch the key to the door!” So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy...” They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm. “Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “What do we have to do?” When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. You’ll be expelled!” “All right.” “Do you think it’s a ghost?” Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.” “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. “Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. “We must be miles under the school,” she said. “My scar keeps hurting— it’s happened before, but never as often as this.” The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing. “Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. “Right Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time-” “I don’t know how deep this thing goes. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. “Yes Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off. “Ready Ready?” “Yes Yes— of course— but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her hands. “Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. “It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox— points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. “Neville Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.” “All right?” Harry whispered. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep. Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. “Why Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape— wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. “So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,” he said greasily. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. Where’s Dumbledore’s office?” “What do you reckon’s next?” “Ready Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. Hermione stepped forward. Ron turned to the other two. Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. “That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. “I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.” “No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. “No No, we’re not. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” “You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak. Hermione, you’d better do that.” Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased— it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep. “Look at you both!” The white queen turned her blank face toward him. Lucky they found Hagrid, don’t you think? “We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. Snape was standing there. “But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron. “What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” He had turned white. “But this is important.” Got time fer a drink?” And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. “We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. Harry turned to Hermione. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. “After what McGonagall and Snape have said? “Now what do we do?” Harry whispered. A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor— and the door was already ajar. “Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They were trapped. “What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered. Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. “I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. This was the first night he hadn’t been upset by it. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. “We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own—” There was no sign of the bottom. “How How?” said Hermione nervously. They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. “What about you?” Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. “You want to go first? He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. “You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. “Can you hear something?” Ron whispered. “Well Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past Fluffy.” The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side! I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione. He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. The black knight nodded. “Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. “See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “All All— all three of us?” “Well Well— yeah— how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? “I needn’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.” Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? And Harry let go. “Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron. “Neville Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot—” Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. “Dunno Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.” “There’s light ahead— I can see something moving.” “We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s.” “I’m ready!” Harry was rubbing his forehead. “Oh Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?” Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?” “They’re keys! “I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. Harry flushed. “I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone first.” “Do we— er— have to join you to get across?” No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper. “I’ll I’ll— I’ll fight you!” So that must mean...” he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. I’d better go and look through my books, there might be something useful...” “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? “What are you three doing inside?” They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell. Harry had a sudden idea. “Yeah Yeah... he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here... Let’s see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted... Why didn’t I see it before?” And he scooted off. “Go on.” “It’s obvious,” said Ron. Hermione ran to turn him over. “Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.” The distant music stopped. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. “Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. Come on, Hermione!” If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway. “They don’t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there’s no other choice... I’ll run.” Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him... “Forget I said it! “Finished yer exams? He pocketed it to use on Fluffy— he didn’t feel much like singing. But that part of the plan didn’t work. They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. “It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared. Harry handed the flute over. “Just tell us what to do.”\n",
            "paragraphs scrambling:\t\t 54 \t Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep. Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?” “Right Right,” said Ron. “See you in a minute, I hope...” “That one!” he called to the others. “That big one— there— no, there— with bright blue wings— the feathers are all crumpled on one side.” Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. “We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. “Ron Ron, you come at it from above— Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I’ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!” Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione’s cheers echoed around the high chamber. “Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare... what did Professor Sprout say?— it likes the dark and the damp.” “So light a fire!” Harry choked. “Yes Yes— of course— but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her hands. “HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” “Oh Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and— FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but... Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were jammed together so he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. “What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered. “It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” “We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry. “You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds. “We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak— it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s office?” They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next- but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. “Snape’s Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?” They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped. Harry had a sudden idea. “Peeves Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.” Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs. “So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,” he said greasily. “My mistake, my mistake— I didn’t see you— of course I didn’t, you’re invisible— forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.” “I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay away from this place tonight.” “I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again. “Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.” And he scooted off. Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. “What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?” “Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. “Yeah Yeah... he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him... an’ I said what I’d always really wanted was a dragon... an’ then... I can’ remember too well, ‘cause he kept buyin’ me drinks... Let’s see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home... So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy...” “And did he— did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. “Well Well— yeah— how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep—” Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. “I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! Hey— where’re yeh goin’?” “We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think— let me think...” The white queen turned her blank face toward him. “Yes Yes...” said Ron softly, “It’s the only way... I’ve got to be taken.” “NO NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted. “That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices! I make my move and she’ll take me— that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!” “But But—” “Do you want to stop Snape or not?” “Ron Ron—” “Look Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!” There was no alternative. They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned- it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. “Ready Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly- the towering white chessmen had no faces. They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. “Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. “I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?” “No No, I don’t!” “All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. “Ready Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go— now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.” He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor— Hermione screamed but stayed on her square— the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d been knocked out. Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway. But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top. “Oh Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything. Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. “Be warned, Potter— any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.” He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. “I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.” “Well Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said. “Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. “I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.” “But Professor—” “Potter Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.” The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. “I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone first.” “You’re mad!” said Ron. “You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!” “SO WHAT” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?” “Brilliant Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron. A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor— and the door was already ajar. “Well Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past Fluffy.” Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. “If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.” “Don’t be stupid,” said Ron. “We’re coming,” said Hermione. Snape was standing there. “Good afternoon,” he said smoothly. They stared at him. “You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted smile. “We were—” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say. “You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around like this, people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can it?” Harry was rubbing his forehead. “I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps hurting— it’s happened before, but never as often as this.” “Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested. “I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning... it means danger’s coming...” “Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. “Yeah Yeah,” said Ron,“ and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis— ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon— Norbert had been bad enough... Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. “You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.” But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. “I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. “I’ll I’ll— I’ll fight you!” “Neville Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot—” “Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” “Yes Yes, but not to us” said Ron in exasperation. “Neville Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.” They had reached another door. “All right?” Harry whispered. “Go on.” Harry pushed it open. A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. “I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.” Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they’d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest. “That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.” Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. “No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. “You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” “Do we— er— have to join you to get across?” The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. “This needs thinking about...” he said. “I suppose we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces...” Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, “Now Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess—” “We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what to do.” “Well Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.” “What about you?” “I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron. The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took. “And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron. “Come on.” But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper. “I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” she stonned. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!” Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. “Harry Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. “Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy— he didn’t feel much like singing. He ran back down to the common room. “We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own—” “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d been making another bid for freedom. “Nothing Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. Neville stared at their guilty faces. “You’re going out again,” he said. “No No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No No, we’re not. Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?” “Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron. “Probably Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there’s no other choice... I’ll run.” He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm. “Now what?” said Ron. “We’ll just have to—” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall. “What are you three doing inside?” It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. “We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. “See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why Why?” Harry swallowed— now what? “It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared. “Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.” “He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now Now?” “Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time-” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor Professor— it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone—” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up. “How do you know—?” she spluttered. “Professor Professor, I think— I know— that Sn— that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.” She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. “White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering across the board. “Yes Yes... look...” A white pawn had moved forward two squares. Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry’s knees were trembling. What if they lost? “Harry Harry— move diagonally four squares to the right.” They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. “Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. “Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.” Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. “Right Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape— wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.” “Why me?” “It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “‘Oh ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong...’” “Oh Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them. “Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is— it’s Devil’s Snare!” “Oh Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. “Shut up. I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione. “Well Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. “What if he’s—?” “He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What do you reckon’s next?” “We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s.” “What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously. “Nothing Nothing— just black— there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.” Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. “You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.” “Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily. “I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” “Why Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. “Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it before?” “What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer. He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. “Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. “I’m ready!” Harry turned to Hermione. “Do something,” he said desperately. Hermione stepped forward. “Neville Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.” She raised her wand. “Petrificus Totalus!” she cried, pointing it at Neville. Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side. “We must be miles under the school,” she said. “Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron. “Lucky Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!” She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing. He glared at them. “You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice. “I’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got it back.” “But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron. “All All— all three of us?” “Oh Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?” “Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go and look through my books, there might be something useful...” “But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” “Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me out after that.” “These birds... they can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione. They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering— glittering? “They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re keys! Winged keys— look carefully. So that must mean...” he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. “...yes ...yes ..yes .yes yes— look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the door!” “But there are hundreds of them!” Ron examined the lock on the door. “We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one— probably silver, like the handle.” Harry pushed the door open. As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them. “What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered. “Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.” “It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well Well, here goes...” He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased— it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep. “Can you hear something?” Ron whispered. Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. “Do you think it’s a ghost?” “I don’t know... sounds like wings to me.” “There’s light ahead— I can see something moving.” They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. “It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!” Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. “What’s this stuff?” were his first words. “Dunno Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!” Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown. “Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.” Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl. “Hullo Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?” “Yes Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off. “No No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?” “Dunno Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.” He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. “It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head— that’s one of the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.” But they didn’t. “It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.” “But what can we—” Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. “Now what do we do?” Harry whispered. “It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way across the room.” Behind the white pieces they could see another door. “How How?” said Hermione nervously. “I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.” He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight’s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell. They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox— points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\n"

            "original txt 2910 \t In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell. They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox— points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they’d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest. “That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.” Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. “No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. “You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” Harry was rubbing his forehead. “I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps hurting— it’s happened before, but never as often as this.” “Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested. “I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning... it means danger’s coming...” Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. “Harry Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but... Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. “Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily. “I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” “Why Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. “Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it before?” “What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer. Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl. “Hullo Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?” “Yes Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off. “No No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?” “Dunno Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.” He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. “It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head— that’s one of the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.” Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. “What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?” “Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. “Yeah Yeah... he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him... an’ I said what I’d always really wanted was a dragon... an’ then... I can’ remember too well, ‘cause he kept buyin’ me drinks... Let’s see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home... So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy...” “And did he— did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. “Well Well— yeah— how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep—” Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. “I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! Hey— where’re yeh goin’?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds. “We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak— it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s office?” They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. “We’ll just have to—” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall. “What are you three doing inside?” It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. “We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. “See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why Why?” Harry swallowed— now what? “It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared. “Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.” “He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now Now?” “Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time-” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor Professor— it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone—” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up. “How do you know—?” she spluttered. “Professor Professor, I think— I know— that Sn— that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.” She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. “Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. “I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.” “But Professor—” “Potter Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.” But they didn’t. “It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.” “But what can we—” Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. Snape was standing there. “Good afternoon,” he said smoothly. They stared at him. “You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted smile. “We were—” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say. “You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around like this, people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can it?” Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. “Be warned, Potter— any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.” He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. “Right Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape— wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.” “Why me?” “It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “‘Oh ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong...’” “Oh Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. “And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron. “Come on.” But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper. “I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” she stonned. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!” Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. “I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.” “Well Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said. The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. “I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone first.” “You’re mad!” said Ron. “You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!” “SO WHAT” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?” He glared at them. “You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice. “I’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got it back.” “But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron. “All All— all three of us?” “Oh Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?” “Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go and look through my books, there might be something useful...” “But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” “Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me out after that.” After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. “Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy— he didn’t feel much like singing. He ran back down to the common room. “We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own—” “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d been making another bid for freedom. “Nothing Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. Neville stared at their guilty faces. “You’re going out again,” he said. “No No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No No, we’re not. Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?” Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. “You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.” But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. “I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. “I’ll I’ll— I’ll fight you!” “Neville Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot—” “Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” “Yes Yes, but not to us” said Ron in exasperation. “Neville Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.” He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. “Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. “I’m ready!” Harry turned to Hermione. “Do something,” he said desperately. Hermione stepped forward. “Neville Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.” She raised her wand. “Petrificus Totalus!” she cried, pointing it at Neville. Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. Hermione ran to turn\n",

He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. His legs sprang together. but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home... “But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” “Professor Professor, I think— I know— that Sn— that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. Neville stared at their guilty faces. He put on a high voice, “‘Oh ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong...’” And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can it?” What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?” “I needn’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.” “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” “You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” He ran back down to the common room. The other two stared at him. Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. “Now Now?” “Enough of this nonsense! his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl. “I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. Harry was rubbing his forehead. “I’m not ill,” said Harry. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? “How do you know—?” she spluttered. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest. “I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone first.” He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. “Dunno Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.” “Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “All All— all three of us?” “Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. Their very last exam was History of Magic. “I’m ready!” “I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” she stonned. “But what can we—” Hermione gasped. “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room. “Don’t you understand? “Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak— it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. “Forget I said it! Harry swallowed— now what? “Finished yer exams? “It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head— that’s one of the pub down in the village. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. “Oh Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?” They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell. But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. Harry and Ron wheeled round. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox— points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. “Hanging around like this, people will think you’re up to something. “I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “Potter Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. “What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up. “Do something,” he said desperately. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they’d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. “Yes Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. “You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.” “Neville Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.” “You’re mad!” said Ron. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. “Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. Hey— where’re yeh goin’?” Losing points doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? “Yeah Yeah... he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here... So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep—” Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. “I’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “How do you think you’d get to the Stone without us? Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. “I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. “Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time-” “Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. “It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared. Did you mention Hogwarts at all?” It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. Let’s see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted... He had turned white. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? Where’s Dumbledore’s office?” Harry flushed. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.” “Why Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. “SO WHAT” Harry shouted. “But Professor—” Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. “You’re going out again,” he said. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape— wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. “That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. “We’ll just have to—” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall. They had practical exams as well. “No No, we’re in a hurry. “But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron. “It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. “Hullo Hullo,” he said, smiling. “See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but... When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. Good day to you.” Voldemort killed my parents, remember?” Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Got time fer a drink?” “Why Why?” “We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own—” “Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? “Neville Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.” And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” “My scar keeps hurting— it’s happened before, but never as often as this.” “Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.” But that part of the plan didn’t work. Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? “Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested. an’ I said what I’d always really wanted was a dragon... an’ then... I can’ remember too well, ‘cause he kept buyin’ me drinks... “Well Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said. “Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. “I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.” Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d been making another bid for freedom. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. “No No, we’re not. Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?” “Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy...” I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! They’re not throwing me out after that.” “You want to be more careful,” said Snape. Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Oh Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. Lucky they found Hagrid, don’t you think? “Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. “Come on.” Hermione, you’d better do that.” “What are you three doing inside?” “Nothing Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. They stared at him. Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; “No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. “Neville Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot—” “You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted smile. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. “You can’t!” said Hermione. “I don’t think you should be breaking any more rules! “It’s obvious,” said Ron. “Good afternoon,” he said smoothly. “I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. Why didn’t I see it before?” “Look Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor Professor— it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone—” Yes, Weasley, from my own house!” He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. You’ll be expelled!” “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. This was the first night he hadn’t been upset by it. Snape was standing there. Hermione stepped forward. “We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. “Why me?” “And did he— did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. “After what McGonagall and Snape have said? But they didn’t. “I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Be warned, Potter— any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. “Harry Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. “What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer. “It’s just lucky I got it back.” In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.” If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side! Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. I’d better go and look through my books, there might be something useful...” “No No, no, no,” said Hermione. You know that night you won Norbert? “We were—” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. “Well Well— yeah— how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper. Harry turned to Hermione. Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy— he didn’t feel much like singing. Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though. They couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.” Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. He glared at them. D’you think he’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? “I’ll I’ll— I’ll fight you!” “Right Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” She raised her wand. “We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. “Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. “He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.” “Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “I think it’s a warning... it means danger’s coming...” “But this is important.” “Yes Yes, but not to us” said Ron in exasperation. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. “You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. “And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron. “Petrificus Totalus!” she cried, pointing it at Neville.\n",
            "paragraphs scrambling:\t\t 24 \t “We’ll just have to—” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall. “What are you three doing inside?” It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. “We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. “See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why Why?” Harry swallowed— now what? “It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared. “Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.” “He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now Now?” “Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time-” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor Professor— it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone—” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up. “How do you know—?” she spluttered. “Professor Professor, I think— I know— that Sn— that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.” She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. “Right Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape— wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.” “Why me?” “It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “‘Oh ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong...’” “Oh Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they’d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest. “That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.” Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. “No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. “You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. “Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily. “I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” “Why Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. “Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it before?” “What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer. Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl. “Hullo Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?” “Yes Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off. “No No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?” “Dunno Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.” He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. “It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head— that’s one of the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.” He ran back down to the common room. “We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own—” “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d been making another bid for freedom. “Nothing Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. Neville stared at their guilty faces. “You’re going out again,” he said. “No No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No No, we’re not. Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?” Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. “What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?” “Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. “Yeah Yeah... he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him... an’ I said what I’d always really wanted was a dragon... an’ then... I can’ remember too well, ‘cause he kept buyin’ me drinks... Let’s see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home... So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy...” “And did he— did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. “Well Well— yeah— how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep—” Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. “I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! Hey— where’re yeh goin’?” Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but... Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. “Harry Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” “And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron. “Come on.” But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper. “I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” she stonned. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!” Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds. “We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak— it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s office?” They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. He glared at them. “You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice. “I’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got it back.” “But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron. “All All— all three of us?” “Oh Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?” “Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go and look through my books, there might be something useful...” “But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” “Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me out after that.” Harry was rubbing his forehead. “I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps hurting— it’s happened before, but never as often as this.” “Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested. “I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning... it means danger’s coming...” “Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. “I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.” “But Professor—” “Potter Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.” Snape was standing there. “Good afternoon,” he said smoothly. They stared at him. “You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted smile. “We were—” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say. “You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around like this, people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can it?” After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. “Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy— he didn’t feel much like singing. Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. “I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.” “Well Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said. He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. “Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. “I’m ready!” Harry turned to Hermione. “Do something,” he said desperately. Hermione stepped forward. “Neville Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.” She raised her wand. “Petrificus Totalus!” she cried, pointing it at Neville. Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. But they didn’t. “It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.” “But what can we—” Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. “Be warned, Potter— any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.” He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. “You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.” But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. “I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. “I’ll I’ll— I’ll fight you!” “Neville Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot—” “Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” “Yes Yes, but not to us” said Ron in exasperation. “Neville Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.” In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell. They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox— points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. “I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone first.” “You’re mad!” said Ron. “You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!” “SO WHAT” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”\n",
            "original txt_2 2897 \t him over. Neville’s jaws were jammed together so he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. “What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered. “It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” “We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry. “You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak. But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top. “Oh Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything. They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. “Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. “Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.” Harry had a sudden idea. “Peeves Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.” Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs. “So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,” he said greasily. “My mistake, my mistake— I didn’t see you— of course I didn’t, you’re invisible— forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.” “I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay away from this place tonight.” “I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again. “Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.” And he scooted off. “Brilliant Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron. A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor— and the door was already ajar. “Well Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past Fluffy.” Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. “If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.” “Don’t be stupid,” said Ron. “We’re coming,” said Hermione. Harry pushed the door open. As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them. “What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered. “Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.” “It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well Well, here goes...” He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased— it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep. “Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. “I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?” “No No, I don’t!” “All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. “What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously. “Nothing Nothing— just black— there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.” Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. “You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.” Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep. Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?” “Right Right,” said Ron. “See you in a minute, I hope...” And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and— FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. “It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!” Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. “What’s this stuff?” were his first words. “Dunno Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!” The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side. “We must be miles under the school,” she said. “Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron. “Lucky Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!” She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing. Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them. “Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is— it’s Devil’s Snare!” “Oh Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. “Shut up. I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione. “Well Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. “Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare... what did Professor Sprout say?— it likes the dark and the damp.” “So light a fire!” Harry choked. “Yes Yes— of course— but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her hands. “HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” “Oh Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. “Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. “Yeah Yeah,” said Ron,“ and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis— ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon— Norbert had been bad enough... “Can you hear something?” Ron whispered. Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. “Do you think it’s a ghost?” “I don’t know... sounds like wings to me.” “There’s light ahead— I can see something moving.” They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. “Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron. “Probably Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there’s no other choice... I’ll run.” He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm. “Now what?” said Ron. “These birds... they can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione. They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering— glittering? “They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re keys! Winged keys— look carefully. So that must mean...” he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. “...yes ...yes ..yes .yes yes— look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the door!” “But there are hundreds of them!” Ron examined the lock on the door. “We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one— probably silver, like the handle.” They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. “That one!” he called to the others. “That big one— there— no, there— with bright blue wings— the feathers are all crumpled on one side.” Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. “We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. “Ron Ron, you come at it from above— Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I’ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!” Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione’s cheers echoed around the high chamber. They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned- it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. “Ready Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly- the towering white chessmen had no faces. “Now what do we do?” Harry whispered. “It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way across the room.” Behind the white pieces they could see another door. “How How?” said Hermione nervously. “I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.” He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight’s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. “Do we— er— have to join you to get across?” The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. “This needs thinking about...” he said. “I suppose we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces...” Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, “Now Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess—” “We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what to do.” “Well Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.” “What about you?” “I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron. The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took. “White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering across the board. “Yes Yes... look...” A white pawn had moved forward two squares. Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry’s knees were trembling. What if they lost? “Harry Harry— move diagonally four squares to the right.” Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown. “Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.” Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. “We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think— let me think...” The white queen turned her blank face toward him. “Yes Yes...” said Ron softly, “It’s the only way... I’ve got to be taken.” “NO NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted. “That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices! I make my move and she’ll take me— that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!” “But But—” “Do you want to stop Snape or not?” “Ron Ron—” “Look Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!” There was no alternative. “Ready Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go— now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.” He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor— Hermione screamed but stayed on her square— the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d been knocked out. Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway. “What if he’s—?” “He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What do you reckon’s next?” “We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s.” They had reached another door. “All right?” Harry whispered. “Go on.” Harry pushed it open. A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. “I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.” He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next- but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. “Snape’s Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?” They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\n",
